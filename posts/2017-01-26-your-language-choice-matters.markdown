# Your Language Choice Matters

In [part one](2017-01-26-language-smell.markdown) of this series, we examined many factors that can contribute to a programming language "smell". 

## How Haskell Stacks Up

Almost all platforms support multiple programming languages, so the most daunting task is often which programming language to use on top. In this section, I will make a case for why the Haskell programming language is a strong contender.

### Consistent Mathematical Foundations

Haskell is based on the lambda calculus mixed with APIs influenced by category theory. Functional programming is well-known for maximizing composability while strong-typing guarantees eliminate entire classes of bugs common to other languages.
