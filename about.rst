Project:M36 is a relational algebra engine setting out to prove that mathematical correctness not only does not impede RDBMS performance, but rather opens doors to new and mathematially-coherent optimizations.

Project:M36 is written entirely in the Haskell programming language and is completely open source.

This blog details the trials of the product team in reaching this lofty goal.
